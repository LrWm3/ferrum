//! https://github.com/viperproject/silver/blob/c4f54b84703a04434b03e97bfea87dbd09870fd2/src/main/scala/viper/silver/frontend/SilFrontend.scala
//!
//! Purpose:
//! Orchestrate CLI configuration, parsing through verification, plugin hooks and reporting.
//!
//! Planned Rust structure:
//! Represent SilFrontend, MissingDependencyException, FrontendStateCache and
//! ApplicationExitReason; retain parser, plugins, verifier, config and timing state. Provide
//! prepare, execute, resetPlugins, phase methods, verification and finish.
//!
//! Behavior to preserve:
//! Plugin order is smoke then refute when enabled, remaining defaults then explicit plugins; warn
//! on duplicates. beforeParse/Resolve/Translate, beforeMethodFilter/Verify, result mapping and
//! beforeFinish run at their respective boundaries. Preserve select/chopper empty warning, sorted
//! warnings/errors, consistency/backend checks, transformed error deduplication, exit codes and
//! exception reporting.
//!
//! Integration:
//! Uses parser::fast_parser, resolver, translator; plugin manager, ast::utility::consistency and
//! chopper, reporter and verifier; providers override phases.
//!
//! Rust adaptations:
//! Follow porting/conventions.md for shared ownership, errors and collection semantics; native
//! runtime substitutions remain provisional.
//!
//! Open decisions:
//! Reconcile mutable cache, plugin/verifier ownership and native plugin registration with
//! frontend and plugin modules.
//!
//! Status: description only; implementation has not started.
