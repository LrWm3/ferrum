# Source descriptions

All 336 mapped Silver/Silicon source and test files and four Ferrum assembly files
have comment-only Rust briefs. Each describes provenance, purpose, planned
structure, behavior, integration, adaptations and open decisions. Implementation
has not started; `described` is a documentation status.

- [sources.toml](sources.toml) pins the two semantic baselines.
- [modules.toml](modules.toml) maps every source file to its Rust destination and
  records reviewed progress. Symbol outlines live in the destination comments.
- [non_rust_files.tsv](non_rust_files.tsv) accounts for the other 1,993 tracked
  upstream paths, including fixtures, resources, documentation, tooling and the
  duplicate Silver submodule. Dispositions are provisional plans, not completed
  asset imports or exhaustive content reviews.
- [conventions.md](conventions.md) separates shared requirements from open Rust
  representation choices. [differences.md](differences.md) records adopted
  behavioral departures once there are any.

Three `gpt-6.1-terra` agents read source files and their relevant collaborators,
wrote separate batches, and performed targeted peer reviews. Coordinator review
included representative source/brief comparisons, mapping and stage checks, and
reconciliation of peer corrections. Higher-risk peer checks covered parser and
plugin transformations, state merging, heap encodings, retries, continuations,
quantified permissions, snapshot caches and function-axiom phases. This does not
prove future code correct or replace the broader testing pass in [PLAN.md](../PLAN.md).

Run the complete description audit from the repository root:

```sh
python3 tools/check_porting.py --complete --upstream
git diff --check
```

`--upstream` requires the pinned Git objects in the sibling checkouts named in
`sources.toml`; omit it for local document checks without those checkouts. To
check selected descriptions while editing, pass their repository-relative paths.
The checker validates inventory coverage, unique destinations, required fields,
source links, reviewed status and comment-only contents. Source-specific prose
still needs human or agent review; passing these checks is not compilation or
behavioral validation.

When implementing a file, retain its pinned source reference, update the brief
and inventory, and replace the description-stage checks with the implementation
checks in the plan. Resolve cross-file representation choices before treating
proposed signatures or ownership as settled.
